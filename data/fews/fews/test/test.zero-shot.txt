The difference between a "finite" and a "<b>nonfinite</b>" Clause can thus be seen to lie in the nature of I: a finite Clause is one which contains a finite I (carrying Tense and Agreement properties); a nonfinite Clause is one which contains a nonfinite I which is tenseless and agreementless.	nonfinite.adjective.1
